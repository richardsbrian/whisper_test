 Here at Rockwell Automations World Headquarters, research has been proceeding to develop a line of automation products that establishes new standards for quality, technological leadership and operating excellence. With customer success as our primary focus, work has been proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of an instrument that would not only provide inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grandmeters. Such an instrument comprised of Dodge Gears and Barings, Reliant Electric Motors, Alan Bradley controls, and all monitored by Rockwell Software is, Rockwell Automations Retro and Calculator.
